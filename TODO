 * "Real" args-parsing/splitting to support quotes, etc (use some lib?)
 * ghc 6.10 support? (patches welcome)
 * minDelay support: the minimum amount of time that must pass between
   two attempted spawns of a program.  A program with a minDelay of 5
   and a delay of 0 would be respawned as soon as possible by angel,
   assuming it had managed to run for at least 5 seconds on the
   previous invocation.
